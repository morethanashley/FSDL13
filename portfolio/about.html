        <h1>WHAT IS FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <h3>Full stack development encompasses the complete process of application software development, including both the front-end and back-end development. The front end consists of the user interface (or UI), and the back end handles the business logic and application workflows that run behind the scenes.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Full stack developers possess the skills and knowledge to work across the entire technology stack, enabling seamless user experiences and developing robust backends.</h3>
